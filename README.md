A demo to test scss import under Windows
==============

Even if the <em>Typescript</em> compiler is used, the code is written with vanilla javascript (".js" as file extension), i.e. ES6/ES2015.


Angular annotations such as <em>component</em>, <em>directive</em>, ... are used but as plain javascript, i.e. without the "@" syntax. Therefor the <em>typescript</em> options <em>emitDecoratorMetadata</em> and <em>experimentalDecorators</em> are disabled.

To run this demo:

    >meteor npm install
    >meteor
